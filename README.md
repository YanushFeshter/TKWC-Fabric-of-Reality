Abstract

The fundamental Constituent of Reality is not particles or fields — it is the Knot (Der Splot). Being is a Web-of-Topological-Relations governed by the modular tensor category Fib x sVec.

Key Constants

D = 2.69 (Topological Bandwidth)

Gamma_raw = 0.862

Gamma_eff = 0.990 (Vacuum Stiffness)

Fusion Rule: Tau x Tau = 1 + Tau
