## Abstract

TKWC proposes a foundational **Inversion**: 

**The "Thing" is not fundamental. Even "Space" is not fundamental. The fundamental Constituent of Reality is the Knot — Der Splot.**

Being is a Web-of-Topological-Relations governed by the modular tensor category **Fib ⊠ sVec**.

## The Axioms

### The Fusion Rule
```
τ × τ = 1 + τ
```

### Master Constants

| Symbol | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **D** | 2.69 | Topological Bandwidth |
| **Γ_raw** | 0.862 | 1 - (1/D²) |
| **Γ_eff** | 0.990 | Renormalized vacuum stiffness |
| **1-Γ** | 0.01 | The Rift |
